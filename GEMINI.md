# Project: Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Muhammad Nurhidayat Gani. It is a single-page, static website designed to showcase his skills, experience, and contact information. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is fully responsive.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **HTML:** The core markup for the website's structure.
*   **CSS:** Used for styling, including layout, colors, and fonts. It utilizes CSS variables and media queries for responsive design.
*   **JavaScript:** Provides interactivity, including a hamburger menu, active navigation link highlighting on scroll, and a typing animation in the hero section.
*   **External Libraries:**
    *   **Font Awesome:** For icons.
    *   **Google Fonts:** For custom fonts.
    *   **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** For scroll animations.
    *   **TypeIt:** for typing animations.

**Architecture:**

The project follows a simple, straightforward architecture:

*   `index.html`: The single HTML file that contains all the content and structure of the website.
*   `style.css`: A single CSS file for all the styling.
*   `script.js`: A single JavaScript file for all the interactivity.
*   `img/`: A directory to store images.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, you can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** The project uses a single `style.css` file for all styles. It makes use of CSS variables for consistent theming.
*   **JavaScript:** The project uses a single `script.js` file for all client-side scripting.
*   **Dependencies:** External libraries are linked via CDNs in the `index.html` file.
